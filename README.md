## What I Learned

- Learned how to make a GitHub action that automatically builds and deploys the GitHub pages.
- Leveraging dictionaries or JSON objects to house data for content, such as work experiences or projects, streamlines the addition of new content in the future. This approach also facilitates the editing of existing content.
- Enhancing overall project organization by storing fundamental information, like primary and secondary colors, as well as fonts, as variables, contributes to simplicity in the editing process.
